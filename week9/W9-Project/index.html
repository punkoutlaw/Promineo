            <b><h2>In The News</h2></b>
            <p>"This group made up of three siblings from Matawan, New Jersey kicks ass and takes names in a winningly dynamic and exciting manner. Ripping and roaring through ten songs worth of pure nitro-fueled rock'n'roll, these guys deliver a thrilling surplus of passionate shouted vocals and tasty fat hooks. The arrangements are quite tight and lively, with fierce hacksaw guitars, churning basslines, and savage jackhammer drums creating a tremendous surging sound that shakes and rattles with utmost hard-stomping ferocity. In short, this is the sort of album you play super loud while constantly pumping your fist in the air. Accolades don't come much better than that."</p>

              “<i>It’s Alright</i>” is the follow up single to their latest track “Teenager” and this new single is sure to pump up fans far and wide! With its electrifying riff, fierce drums and sing out loud chorus it will have you shouting at the top of your lungs “HEY-NA-HEY-NA”! You’ll be rocking out and jumping around to its ferocious, melodic beats all while cleaning the house (‘cause we’re all still doing that, right?!).
