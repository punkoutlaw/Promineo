// ECMAScript (or ES6) was introduced in 2015 and included a host of updates and refinements. 

// DEFINING VARIABLES

// const - lets you define a variable that cannot be changed
// let - lets you define a variable in and outside ofa code block. Nested closures can access higher level ones, but higher level closures cannot access nested ones.
// var - lets you define a variable that can be changed further down your code line

// TEMPLATE LITERALS

// Using `` you can write a string without having to concat words,variables or spaces manually. 
// If you want to put a variable inside your `` string, you would write ${insert variable}.

// ARROW FUNCTIONS

// You don't have to say 'function' when declaring a arrow function =>.
// If you have one parameter, you do not need ().
// If you are using {}, you need to use the 'return' statement.

// CALLBACKS

// Callbacks are useful when you want to run code that is defined or returns a value later (that it 'calls' back)

// PROMISES

// Anything that hits a promise runs and then does something when it's finished

// Watch a video on 'Promises'
